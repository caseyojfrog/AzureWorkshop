Configure the token for the following scopes.\n* repo (all) * admin:repo_hook (read, write) * admin:public_key (read, write) Click Generate token.\n Copy the token.\n Go to your JFrog Platform instance at https://\u0026lt;servername\u0026gt;.jfrog.io.\n Login to your JFrog Platform instance with your credentials.  Once logged into the environment, you will be presented with the landing page.  On the left sidebar menu, select Pipelines ► Integrations.  Click on Add an Integration.\n Give this integration the name GitHub.\n For the Integration Type, choose GitHub.\n Paste your GitHub Personal Access Token into the Token field.

For the Integration choose the GitHub Integration that you created previously named GitHub. For the Repository Full Name, specify your Horae repository name in the form [username]/Horae. Leave the Branch as master. For the Pipeline Config Filter, specify _pipelines/base_.*yml. Click Create.   It will take a few moments for JFrog Pipelines to sync the pipelines from your new Pipelines Source. During this time, JFrog Pipelines will load and process the pipelines for syntax, resources and dependencies. When complete, you should see a Success status. 9. Click on Logs on the left to view more details on the sync process. With your pipelines added, we are now ready to execute the pipelines, initialize our platform and build our artifacts!\n"

	"content": "The JFrog Platform is designed to meet the growing needs of companies to develop and distribute software. It provides DevOps with the tools needed to create, manage and deploy software with ease. These tools cover everything from binary management, artifact maturity, security and vulnerability protection, CI/CD orchestration, release management, analytics and distribution.\nJFrog Artifactory is an Artifact Repository Manager that fully supports software packages created by any language or technology. Furthermore, it integrates with all major CI/CD and DevOps tools to provide an end-to-end, automated solution for tracking artifacts from development to production.\nJFrog Xray provides universal artifact analysis, increasing visibility and performance of your software components by recursively scanning all layers of your organization’s binary packages to provide radical transparency and unparalleled insight into your software architecture.\nJFrog Distribution empowers DevOps to distribute and continuously update remote locations with release-ready binaries.\nJFrog Artifactory Edge accelerates and provides control of release-ready binary distribution through a secure distributed network and edge nodes.\nJFrog Mission Control and Insight is your DevOps dashboard solution for managing multiple services of Artifactory, Xray, Edge and Distribution.\nJFrog Access with Federation provides governance to the distribution of artifacts by managing releases, permissions and access levels.\nJFrog Pipelines helps automate the non-human part of the whole software development process with continuous integration and empowers teams to implement the technical aspects of continuous delivery.\nAll of these JFrog Platform components are designed and developed to work together out-of-the-box with minimal configuration. Management and monitoring of your software delivery lifecycle from build to distribution is accessible though a central, unified user interface. The JFrog platform is enterprise ready with your choice of on-prem, cloud, multi-cloud or hybrid deployments that scale as you grow.\n "

The Pipelines provided in this tutorial include two pre-configured pipelines that will provide you the experience in building and publishing a multi-stage web application.\n gradle-build creates a Java web app which displays some images.\n npm-build builds a NPM user interface that connects to the Java web app.\n  Throughout all of the CI/CD pipelines, all artifacts are pushed to Artifactory. Artifacts in Artifactory are annotated with metadata, especially in the case of builds which come with exhaustive metadata facilitating full traceability. This, for example, prevents the deletion of dependencies which are needed by a build. We’ll see this later on in the tutorial when we use the Tree Browser in Artifactory to view one of the artifacts produced in our build.  "
