To get started, you will need to fork two GitHub repositories. These repositories contain the files that are needed for the lab.

- https://github.com/shimib/Horae - Contains our JFrog pipelines for configuring our Artifactory server and building our Java webapp and NPM user interface.

- https://github.com/shimib/project-examples - Contains our webapp code which consists of the Java webapp and NPM user interface.

1. Navigate to each of these repositories GitHub using the links above and fork them to your account.
2. In the top-right corner of the GitHub repository page, click **Fork**. Do this for both repositories. 
3. In your terminal, clone each of the new forks to your local git directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/[username]/Horae.git
```

```
$ git clone https://github.com/[username]/project-examples
```
 In the next sections, you will make changes to the files in these repositories.
