Similar to the GitHub Integration, in the following steps you will configure an Artifactory Integration that allows JFrog Pipelines to also access your Artifactory repositories in order to publish your artifacts and build info. You will do this by creating an API key.

1. In your JFrog Platform instance, go your profile and select **Edit Profile**.
2. Enter your password and click **Unlock** to edit the profile.
3. In the **Authentication Settings** section, click the gear icon to generate an API key.
