To get started, you will need to fork two GitHub repositories. These repositories contain the files that are needed for the lab.

- https://github.com/shimib/Horae

- https://github.com/shimib/project-examples

1. Navigate to each of these repositories and fork them to your account.
2. In the top-right corner of the GitHub repository page, click **Fork**. Do this for both repositories. 
3. In your terminal, clone each of the new forks to your local git directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/Horae.git
```

```
$ https://github.com/<username>/project-examples
```
 In the next sections, you will make changes to the files in these repositories.
